# helloworld_webgRPC
A tiny little project to test connection via gRPC between a webBrowser and a Python Server

TIP: To test build files, run "npm run build" and "python3 -m http.server 8081" => 8081 is a generic port so we can access the files


First start with:
npm install

If you want to start dev server:
npm run start

If you want to build a production build:
npm run build
